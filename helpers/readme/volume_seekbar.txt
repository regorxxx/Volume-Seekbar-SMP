FAQ:
----
	• How to control dynamic colors artwork source?
	  It can be set at the background 'Art mode' sub-menu.

	• And selection/now playing source?
	  Idem.

	• How to show the artwork as background instead of a solid color?
	  Art mode transparency must be non-zero, and slider background
	  color must be disabled (-none-) too. In such case the background
	  will be governed only by the background sub-menu settings.
	  Adjusting the transparency and color mode, different overlays
	  may be drawn too.
